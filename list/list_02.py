# Creating a Dictionary with List Comprehension
# You have two lists, one of keys ["name", "age", "occupation"] and another of 
# values â€‹â€‹["John", 30, "Engineer"]. Create a dictionary by combining both lists using List Comprehension.

# Nesting List Comprehensions
# Given a list of lists (an array):

# Calculates the transposed array using a nested List Comprehension.

# List Comprehension with an else clause
# Given a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], create a new list by multiplying 
# the even numbers by 2 and leaving the odd numbers as is.
